# Meadowlark-Mini

Dual deploy programable flight computer for amature rocketry. Equipt with a beeper, physical interrupt, battery charger/monitoring, ignighter indicators, logging to MicroSD, IMU, and Pressure sensor. The goal is to offer a feature rich contnroller that can fit inside a 29mm chassis with the creature comforts of modern controllers. The system is powered by a onboard RP2040 microcontroller. Running at 125MHz with dual core operation for data collection and flight tracking.
