### Known Issues
* Move Boot pads closer together
* Add reset pads for pico-SDK development
* Fix battery connector positive and negative poles are backwards (Swaped connector for testing)

I ordered the PCBs with all of the china only components on one side of the board to to save on shipping and assembly time.

I then assembled the bottom of the board by hand.

With connectors on both sides of the board and an exposed PCB I wanted to protect the board. I made a two part case that is minimal, acts as a standoff for the board and can lock the microSD card in completely with the top installed.
