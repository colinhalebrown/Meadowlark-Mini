### Known Issues
* Move Boot pads closer together
* Add reset pads for pico-SDK development
* Fix battery connector positive and negative poles are backwards (Swaped connector for testing)

I ordered the PCBs with all of the china only components on one side of the board to to save on shipping and assembly time.

I then assembled the bottom of the board by hand.

With connectors on both sides of the board and an exposed PCB I wanted to protect the board. I made a two part case that is minimal, acts as a standoff for the board and can lock the microSD card in completely with the top installed.

The case is designed in two parts, the top is intended to protect the components while not muting the buzzer and allowing the sensors to get fresh air. The bottom of the case brings the battery connector flush to the mounting surface and protects the components on the bottom.
